This is my website. You can visit it at [http://duncanmcisaac.com/](http://duncanmcisaac.com/).

It's built using Gatsby, and deploys to Netlify on each commit to master. 

I don't know React very well, so I borrowed some design patterns (and a bit of code) from https://github.com/poteto/no.lol/. 

todo:

-[] Customize site background
-[] Add media queries to reduce marginBottom of bio on mobile; to left-align icons
  - Just consider splitting `Bio` into two components and including both on home and only one on posts
-[] Figure out why icon hovering isn't working
-[] Migrate over the checkbox code / writing. Will need to sort out how to add JS to the page.
-[] Add SEO
-[] Add tags
