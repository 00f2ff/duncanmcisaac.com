How do you feel?  
I feel the pain of millions   
This is what America feels like  
And it makes me want to throw up  
But that’s counterproductive  
I need to show up  

America is a collage  
But when the cops look at it   
All they see is printer paper  
They only look for marks  
Arrest as white-out  

It’s like a warzone  
Inspired by the “strongmen”  
Acted out by the weak men  
Hiding in their bunkers  
Afraid of diversity  
Afraid to face the angry faces of adversity  

Police tatter the Constitution with rubber bullets  
Trample on your right to protest with horses  
Fight the peace with bombs and gas  
They want to make you cry  

Peaceful protesters attacked like insurgents  
America’s military is bored  
We’re waging a forever war on terror  
When we run out of terrorists we just make some more  
We have a democratic republic  
Slipping into a fascist republic  
The preservation of democracy is abhorred  

It’s quite explicit  
That if you are complicit  
You’re trying to make America nevermore
