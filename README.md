This is my website. You can visit it at [http://duncanmcisaac.com/](http://duncanmcisaac.com/).

It's built using Gatsby, and deploys to Netlify on each commit to master. 

I don't know React very well, so I borrowed some design patterns (and a bit of code) from https://github.com/poteto/no.lol/. 

todo:

- [] Customize site background
- [] Fix bio wrapping on mobile devices (needs formatting & media queries)
- [] Figure out why icon hovering isn't working
- [] Make icons a one-liner with the bio on the bottom of blog pages
