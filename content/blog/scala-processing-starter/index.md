I've always been a big fan of using <a target="_blank" href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> for generative and interactive design, and for building hacky Android interfaces to explore different HCI techniques. Although the IDE that comes bundled with Processing works fine for small programs, more complex ones involving a lot of different classes and sophisticated interaction mechanisms are difficult to reason about without the help of a more advanced IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse. Whereas software engineering is 80% googling for answers to questions and 20% trying to understand whether or not those answers are relevant to the codebase, I’ve found that when the question is along the lines of, “How to use IntelliJ for Processing?” the scales tip farther toward the googling side.

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Duncan93/scala-processing-starter">scala-processing-starter</a> distills a lot of that googling (and even some of my own problem solving!) into a barebones starter project. It <i>might</i> also work for Java programs, and while it’s not perfect, I hope to continue adding substance as I start coding with Processing again after a three-year hiatus.
